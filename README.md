# Introduction

This blog is written in gulp.js and uses SCSS font-style, it is hosted on GitHub and it is translated in web-page through  via the GitHub-pages. 
In addition, it is powered by Travis CI, that builds and tests the whole projects before auto-deploying it by creating a branch (gh-pages) 
and pushing it back to the my_blog.git repository by making use of the travis-deploy.sh script found under the tools in the root directory.
