\textit{
Greece, the country of democracy, the birthplace of great philosophers and scientists, 
the country of culture and art, but also a country that does not lack environmental 
beauty. 
This charm of Greece's environmental beauty lies in the vast number of islands which offer 
simplicity, relaxation, and endless moments of happiness. 
A pleasant feeling covers me upon landing on an island; the adventurous feeling 
is immediately born and a desire of discovering it feels me in every time. 
Before start pursuing my Doctorate degree, in Athens, I have never visited any 
Greek island before. 
However, after starting visiting them, my jaws dropped every time. 
A feeling of enthusiasm covers my mind of each islands unique character, 
their different way of living, and the openness of their locals.
Many times, I catch my self thinking the same thing, ``when I become pensioner I am 
going to by a small house in a Greek island and living a chill, quiet, and easy 
going live...''

\NewsItem{A visit in Haven}
\NewsAuthor{Stefanos Georgiou}
In 2010, Greece was officially announced as a country of economic crisis, 
a fact that goes on over eight years, nowadays. 
However, Greece is never on crisis on the unimaginable beauty and charm 
of its environment and more specifically its islands. 
The combination of sunny weather, almost all year along,
with the substantial and tasty portions of food, the great hospitality of its people, and the 
intense nightlife are the reasons making many tourists daydreaming when they talk 
about Greece all over the world.

According to Wikipedia, Greece has around 1,200 to 1,600 islands where 227 
are inhabited. 
It also offers beaches with various sandy colours such as brown, white, golden, 
pink, and volcanic black. 
Alongside, it is a country with the most blue flagged beaches in Europe that 
indicates the clean waters. 
Tourists can enjoy their stay in islands through hotels, Airbnb apartments, 
or even camping sites which various of them do exist. 
However, my suggestion is not to stay for a long time at hotel resorts, but, instead 
travel to different villages, talk with locals, go the places that also locals 
go to learn from this culture.

Through my stay in Greece,
I was fortunate to visit at least ten different islands from various seas.
Greece's islands can be found both in Aegean and Ionian seas. 
The distinguishing aspects of Aegean islands is the dry climate and environment,
but, warm seas. 
On the contrast, Ionian islands are less dry with a rich environment
and many trees, but, with much colder waters, in general. 
The Greek islands are group in six clusters: the \textit{Argo-Saronic},
\textit{Cyclades}, \textit{North Aegean}, \textit{Dodecanese},
\textit{Sporades}, \textit{Ionia} islands also know as \textit{Eptanisa}, 
and \textit{Crete} that is a single large island.
I have toured islands in both seas but primarily from the Aegean sea. 
Therefore most of the discussion is going to be for the Aegean islands. 

My aim with this article is to expose the hidden magic of the islands
through some of my adventures, feelings, historical events,
and thoughts to encourage people that paradise is not far away,
it is much closer than most of them think. 
  
\NewsItem{Aigina, my first island}
By the end of April 2016, when the temperature usually is much higher than \ang{30}, 
a friend of mine, that we used to serve in the army for our mandatory duty, gave me 
an unexpected call. 
He was visiting Athens with his girlfriend for a few days and he wanted to travel to 
Aigina and to catch up with me.
A relatively big island that is located at Saronic bay and less than an hour 
distance away from Piraeus port by boat and famous mostly for the Aigina's peanuts; 
which is actually...a kind of pistachio. 

Until that time, I have never been before to any island nor on a boat and since 
I am always up for trying new things, I answered his call. 
In general, in low season, there is no need to pre-book boat tickets since not 
many people are visiting the islands. 
After we bought our tickets, we entered the boat and took place just outside
to have a better view and stair the seagulls.  
The seagulls were flying most of the time next to the boat to fish. 
Many people were trying to feed them to take pictures with them. 
It is necessary to be careful since the seagulls can also bite your hand while 
trying to get the food out of it. 
Therefore, we enjoy the view until we reached our destination, the port of Aigina. 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/aigina_2.jpg}
	\par\textit{Aigina's port and clean waters}
\end{center}

The port of Aigina, where we disembarked, is located in the central city. 
Each island of Greece has its own central city, and in most case,
a port can also be found there. 
In the old times, for some islands, the locals were building their main cities 
on mountains away from the port. 
This was done since to avoid quick attacks from pirates. 
However, it was not the case for Aigina. 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/aigina_3.jpg}
	\par\textit{Aigina's main city}
\end{center}

Once we disembarked, we took a ride towards Marathonas beach since it is found 
outside of the city and the bus schedules are not in favour of the public. 
However, on my second tour to Aigina, I was more prepared and I rented a bike which 
was much fun and a cheaper solution.
The organised beaches in Greece offer umbrellas, beach beds, and bars from where 
you can enjoy ice-cold coffees such as frappe, cold beers, and different snacks. 
Even tho it was May and the outside temperature more that \ang{35} the water was 
quite cold for my Cypriot standards. 
Nevertheless, it was also refreshing and my first bath, so I tried to enjoy it 
as much as I could without showing that it was cold. 

After our ``cold'' experience on Marathonas beach, we made our way back to the city 
where we enjoyed some local food and Aigina's peanuts. 
Also, we took our time to explore the city centre that provides different types of 
restaurants, mainly we Greek cuisine,  and small narrow roads where decorated with 
many bougainvillaeas, white house, and clean streets. 
Just walking in those streets of Aigina you can get the feeling that some things 
in that island remained unaffected by the past of time. 
But still, the beauty and their simplicity can rest the human's soul. 
After our walk, we took the boat to return to the noisy Athens once again.

\NewsItem{Salamina}
A place where one of the most significant naval battles between Greece
and the Persian army took place. 
At that time, Greece was separated in different kingdoms. 
Therefore, they united their forces to take down their common enemy. 
Also, there is a large naval base at Salamina that is hosting multiple types of 
warships.

By the begging of May 2016, one of our lab's PhD fellow, Maria Kechagia, invited 
the whole lab in her hometown, which is in Salamina for a day trip. 
Salamina is an island that is almost 15 minutes away by ferry boat. 
Therefore, we took the opportunity and we loaded two cars on the ferry to make our 
way easier in Salamina. 
The difference between the ferry and the traditional boat is that the ferry is much 
smaller and slower. 
That means strong waves and long distances are troublesome.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/salamina_1.jpg}
	\par\textit{The island of Salamina}
\end{center}

Our first stop in Salamina was at Maria's home where her parents were expecting us. 
Her mother, a few months ago had to go through a surgery and blood was required for 
that. 
Upon request, I immediately went for blood donation, a fact that her mother remembers 
till today and every time we meet she is bringing me cookies and other kinds of sweets. 
In our company, we also had a PhD student from India who came with his wife and 
four years old kid. 
Greek parents are going crazy when they see kids and they try to cheer them with 
every kind of sweet of toys they have, no matter from which country they are. 
However, they did not only treat the kid well but us also. 
Once we sit outside in their garden that was full of trees, plants and flowers, 
Maria's mother brought us coffee, cookies, and homemade ice-cream. 
Afterwards, they also suggested us beaches to visit and places to eat lunch.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/salamina_2.jpg}
	\par\textit{Beach in Salamina}
\end{center}

After the beach, we went to have lunch at a local restaurant where we order ``kotsi''. 
This food is part of the pork's leg, cooked in an oven with sauce and different 
species. 
Literally, the meat was falling off the bone by merely touching it. 
It was one of the most amazing ``kotsi'' we ever had. 
Even after two years, our PhD fellow Antonis Gkortzis is still mentioning that food.     

\NewsItem{Vacations in Milos}
Summer in Athens is almost unbearable and an escape plan is going to a Greek island. 
Ana, a beautiful blond Slovenian girl with charming blue eyes 
and a crystal smile, came to visit me to go to Milos island. 
Milos is an island in the Cyclades before Santorini, however, much more 
cheaper, with fewer tourists, and beautify sandy beaches. 
Moreover, most of the Cyclades islands share the common characteristics as 
white houses, flat roofs, blue doors and window labels, in most of the cases. 
Therefore, in mid of July 2016, we travelled there by boat that took us more than four hours to reach 
our destination. 

Milos has many beaches that are inaccessible by cars or foot and to visit them 
a sailing boat is required. 
To this end, we booked a whole day sailing tour with Ana to explore and enjoy 
the hidden places of Milos. 
Again, for me, it was my first time travelling by sailing boat, an  experience 
which came to be fascinating and enjoyable since I love snorkelling and sailing 
boats offer this opportunity on a large scale. 
Besides, we went close to an island called Poliaignos,
a rocky peninsula next to Milos that is mostly inhabited
but goats and the shepherds that are watching over them.
Poliaigos had the clearest blue water I have ever seen in my life. 
Even tho the water's depth was more than 15 meters the bottom was quite 
visible, but, also cold.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/milos_poliaigos.jpg}
	\par\textit{The crystal blue waters of Poliaigos}
\end{center}

From the sailing boat, we also saw some of the traditional fishermen houses.  
The fishermen were colouring their houses doors in different colours 
to recognise them during the night. 
This was done to avoid anchoring their boat outside the wrong parking spot.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/milos_houses.jpg}
	\par\textit{Fisher men houses in Milos}
\end{center}

During the night, our sailing trip reached its end. 
Overalls, the trip was tiresome since the rough sea forced us to try to keep
our balance, in the boat, most of the time and in combination with the intense sun, 
we get exhausted. 
However, it was a great new adventurous experience for me and one that 
I definitely repeat. 
Furthermore, we have visited coastlines that are not reachable by car and it 
made it worth our time and the energy we spend on the trip. 

A rather daring act from us was to use the local buses for transportation which 
end up being a cumbersome and time costly action. 
Many times, we ended up in entirely wrong places and far away from our 
destination. 
However, every time locals were stopping to give us drive and to talk to us. 
In addition, they were really interested in our own stories too and many times 
they were suggesting us places for meals with the best value for many deals. 
Also, an old guy took us with his car at one of the most beautiful beaches of 
Milos, the Firiplaka beach. 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/milos_beach.jpg}
	\par\textit{Me at Firiplaka beach}
\end{center}

Firiplaka is a magnificent golden sandy beach with blue and clear waters 
as depicted in the above picture. 
The particular beach is partially organised while the most significant part of it is not. 
It offers a small number of umbrellas and seabeds free of use with the policy 
of first come first serve. 
Also, it has a small kiosk that offers many refreshments, snacks, tasty 
and big bowls with Greek yoghurt with various seasonal fruits, walnuts, and honey 
for very reasonable prices. 

A different type of beach is the Sarakiniko. 
Sarakiniko means piratear and it is a white rocky bay as illustrated in the 
picture below. 
Its schema offers warm and eases waters to its swimmers with a small beach surrounded 
by many fig trees. 
As it is among the famous places of Milos and most of the time is quite crowded. 
However, it offers many spots and people can also lay on the rocky parts too.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/milos_beach_2.jpg}
	\par\textit{The Sarakiniko beach}
\end{center} 

After we left from the beach, we made our way towards Plaka of Milos
to experience the sunset. 
Plaka is a tiny city established on a hill in the heart of the island. 
It further offers some restaurants, bars, and cafeterias
where tourists can enjoy a meal or a drink alongside the sunset. 
For dinner, we had delicious shrimps with cheese form Milos
and grilled vegetables at a local restaurant while we enjoyed cold Mythos beer. 
Moreover, we didn't misuse our chance to enjoy the sunset
while listening to Hans Zimmer's songs such as ``The last of Mochicans'',
``Braveheart'', and so on,
a tradition that I earned from my PhD fellow Antonis Gkortzis and I still follow.

\NewsItem{My dream is to fly}
After returning from Milos, I received news that a dear friend of mine,
Vojkan Stoitsik (a cool University assistant professor at Greek literature),
was advancing for vacations at Lefkada island. 
Lefkada is a big island exposed at the Ionian sea with rich environmental beauty,
many trees, and cold waters.
Therefore, I booked a bus ticket towards Lefkada. 
Well, next time, I should be more cautious with the timetables considering
it was an eight hours bus-trip which depleted my energy until I reached my destination. 
Needless to say, I have spent around 16 hours (round-trip)
just to stay in Lefkada for almost a day. 

The island of Lefkada is connected with the central part of Greece
through a bridge since it is very close; thus no boat is required to reach it. 
It also has a charming and old city centre that allows numerous restaurants, cafeterias, and bar. 
Besides, close to port many bars and nightclubs are placed with loud music and fancy lights. 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/kathisma_beach.jpg}
	\par\textit{Kathisma beach at Lefkada}
\end{center}

My first and only visit at Lefkada's beaches was at ``Kathisma''. 
Because Lefkada is on the west side of Greece it advances the possibility
of paragliding due to the powerful ``west winds'';
and of course I am continually up especially for extreme challenges. 
The particular team, or paragliding, offered two venues:
i) seven minutes of flying from almost 300 meters,
and ii) ten to twelve with fall from 600 meters. 
Nevertheless, I was equipped with a Go Pro camera to capture the moment. 

As soon as we reached the top of the hill,
the instructor prepared the paragliding equipment and attached me on it. 
At that moment, before the jump, I was not sure if I was feeling scared
from the unknown feeling (of flying) or excited from it.
Honestly, I was really thinking to back down;
however, next to us it was located a cafeteria,
and many customers came out to see the show.
Well, after having there an audience it would be a disgrace to chicken out.
Therefore, I found the courage to take the leap.
As soon as we jumped (me attached together with the instructor)
the bizarre feeling went away, and a pretty comfortable feeling filled me in. 
I was feeling relax and calm,
I was enjoying the unique view from the top that mother nature freely offered to us.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/paragliding.jpg}
	\par\textit{It is manoeuvre time!!!}
\end{center}

Upon reaching on the top of the beach, the instructor notified me that
we can hold amazing manoeuvres with the paragliding,
but only if I required it, and of course I allowed on that. 
While performing manoeuvres, we were losing height much faster;
however, the whole concept was fast, immediate, and at some points,
I even felt I was missing my breath. 
But I could say it was one of the most exciting parts of the whole process,
and one that everybody should strive.

After the day passed and I had to take the bus back to Athens. 
The whole trip was very short but full with excitement
due to the paragliding experience and definitely one that
I will not forget for some time.

\NewsItem{Surviving at Kea?}
August is a month where most of the Greeks are resting
and replenishing their batteries for the new season. 
To this end, in August 2017,
we determined to have a camping adventure on an island
also to chill out and enjoy our time on the beach. 
Our decision was Kea, a rocky and mountaineer island
approximately an hour away from Lavrio's port.

Our team, see picture below, formed from my PhD fellow Antonis Gkortzis
(a beard scout boy guy, capable barman, good but cold sense of humour, rum and beer addict);
Daniela Mikeli (the girl who always smiles, jokes around, and has unlimited energy,
and looks super cute until she starts drinking beers and watching football games
were most of the times she is cursing);
Marios and Maria Zacharia (the sugar couple who recently got a cute pair of twins
and they are always up for good food and burgers).  
Antonis was our master and commander for the whole camping experience since
he was following the tradition from his childhood.
Needlessly to say, he is always branded as a team leader from all team members
because he is planning most to the events by himself. 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/the_dream_team.jpg}
	\par\textit{Me, Daniela, Maria \& Marios, Antonis}
\end{center}

The camping side in Kea was organised, that means they had bathrooms,
restaurants, and electricity. 
For myself, Antonis, and Daniela we had a single big tend
and we had another one for Marios and Maria. 
Our daily agenda for the next three days mainly covered activities
such as hitting the beach, having beers and cocktails
(from Antonis who is always equipped with the necessary barman package)
and trail walks in the wild.

During the first day, we where mainly chilling out on the beach
since we arrived in the afternoon and I was also exhausted
from conference paper submission just a day ago. 
Due to the lack of sleep, I went to bed relatively early. 
However, I didn't realise that I haven't closed the tent's mosquito net
all the way up.  
As an outcome, we all heard Antonis during the night cursing out loud
while mosquitoes had a feast party on him.  

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/way_to_beach.jpg}
	\par\textit{Our little adventure}
\end{center}

As the next day's trial, Antonis found a trail path that had as a destination
an unorganised beach with some ancient ruins. 
According to his information, the path was smooth and short, around 15 minutes. 
Therefore, we commenced our small adventure at 10:00 o'clock in the morning. 
We arrived by cars at the old mine (that was the starting point),
and we prepared our backpacks to start the tail. 
However, we only took three litters of water as we were anticipating a short journey. 
Who would ever think that the trail took us an hour to reach our destination
that also included a rough downhill on the way?
Upon reaching our goal, we immediately run out of the water,
and there was nothing nearby to refill our supplies. 
We were alone in the wild at a fantastic beach as shown in the picture below. 
To this end, we took our time to at least enjoy the beach before we head back. 
Going back without water supplies was not only challenging but a survival task too
because we started feeling dizzy due to dehydration.   
We spent almost an hour and a half to reach our cars where
we didn't have any water apart from a fridge back with ice cold beers. 
That time it didn't matter us, we were drinking them like water! 

As we made our way back home in the next days,
we were sure that the particular experience,
of the camping and our survival in the wild, will not be forgotten that easy. 
As a matter of fact, we still discuss and make jokes on those events while 
drinking beers and enjoy a barbecue.

\NewsItem{Can't say no to raki}
Mid of August 2017, the whole Greece is on vacations,
Athens looks like a ghost town since most of its inhabitance are on holidays. 
By that time, three friends of mine, from the masters, came to visit me. 
Our international team (a French, a Nigerian, an Indian, and a Cypriot)
had an aim of visiting Chania, one of the most tourist regions of Crete island.   

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/chania_1.jpg}
	\par\textit{Fisayo, Alex, Me, and Rohan}
\end{center}

Such a trip through August requires careful planning from far ahead
since it is high season and most of the places are booked in advance. 
Therefore, we made all the crucial step such booking apartments,
boat tickets, rent a car, and fixed a plan of potential areas that
we would like to attend during our stay there. 
Since none of the guys had the boat travelling experience before,
we determined to have reserved seats and allow them to feel the moment. 
However, the eight hours boat trip was surely an exhausting decision
and one I would most probably avoid in the future.  
Besides, we had to choose a driver in our team,
a one that could handle the hard and narrow streets of Crete
without getting us killed. 
To choose among a Cypriot, a French, a Nigeria, and an India,
for driving was a tough choice. 
As a rational choice seems to be me, however, in Cyprus,
we drive from the opposite side of the road. 
Rohan didn't know how to drive, and Fisayo hasn't updated his driving license
to a European one. 
Therefore, we ended up letting Alexandre the French/Italian guy to drive. 
Due to his French blood, as he said, he had to complain about every narrow 
and poorly maintained street we engaged in our path. 
Even though he complained a lot,
he did an excellent job by giving us a safe drive
until the end of our stay in Crete. 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/seitan_limani.jpg}
	\par\textit{Seitan Limani}
\end{center}

Among our first options to visit was Seitan Limani. 
Towards our way to Seitan Limani, we stopped and had lunch at the 
``Three porks''. 
A simple restaurant, regularly for students considering its location
that was outside of a University, with delicious and inexpensive food. 
A fact the struck us about Cretan cousin was the raki
which was served to us at every restaurant we have been,
and not just a glass of it. 
Since Alexadre was our diver, Fisayo was not drinking,
and Rohan had issues with his liver, I had to consume the raki all by my self,
something that I did not mind at all. 
When we arrived Seitan Limani during the afternoon, it was way too crowded. 
Also, there was not a straightforward path towards the beach
apart from a very rough downhill way. 
One of those paths that could easily fall and break your neck
if you do not have wild goat's climbing skills. 
However, it did not stop locals or tourists to go down there
and enjoy its beautiful and refreshing blue water as depicted in the picture below. 
One of the locals of the particular beach was a wild goat
that was approaching people on the beach to get or snatch food from their belongings. 
Despite this, it offers an unusual sight for the tourists
who were also are trying to take selfies with a goat.   

Behind the central city's ports of Chania,
one could find many hidden places and restaurants that are less franchised
and offer the traditional flavours of Crete. 
You may lose the fantastic view of the port;
however, I believe it is worth more to have satisfying food
at a much more decent price. 
Before going to Chania, I consulted a friend of mine, Ilias Dolaptsitis, 
to accommodate us with guidelines such as restaurants that we should visit
and what kind of foods we must try. 
I could say I was pretty pleased with everything we ate at Chania
and particularly with their raki that I was still consuming alone.

Driving in Crete is quite a difficulty and a tough task. 
It gets even more challenging when you are driving through the mountains
where the streets much more narrow and when the buses are coming by and forcing you off-road. 
We had to go through this experience while going towards Efalonisi beach. 
However, driving through the mountains and experiencing the beautiful environment
of Crete paid us back for the whole struggle..
Elafonisi beach is just imaginary, beautiful white sand
and crystal clear water can be found all along the coast-line. 
Also, in some parts, pink and black sand exists which provides a spectacular view
while combined with sea's blue colour.

Also, Elafonisi is amongst the most famous tourist temptations for Chania
as it is considered one of the most beautiful beaches of Crete. 
The beach is partially organised allowing all the convenience for the tourists
and locals. 
The road towards Elafonisi was tiresome and cumbersome,
but the view of the beach at the end was charming and mesmerising us to stay for longer. 
However, driving during the night through the mountains was out of the question
for our French driver!

\NewsItem{Small but beautiful Agkistri}
After coming back from Chania, with the international team, Rohan and Alexandre 
had to leave. 
Therefore, me and Fisayo, we decided to have one more little adventure by travelling 
to very small island just next to Aigina, the Agkistri. 
Agkistri's direct translation is the ``fishing hook''. 
To this end, we took a boat from Pireaus early morning and after an hour we 
reached our destination.

As soon as we disembarked at Agkistri's port, we rented two bicycles. 
I really enjoy cycling in the islands when they are not mountaineer since it 
releases childhood memory of freedom.  
Since it was my first time at Agkistri we asked local for information such as 
the best restaurants and beaches to visit. 
People mostly suggested us to visit the Chalikiada beach. 
Therefore, we made our way there while cycling next to the seaside and enjoying 
the beautiful view as illustrated below.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

Chalikiada is a nude beach at the north west part of the island and ``hidden'' from 
the public (this is what we said after we passed the same road 3 times until we found 
the passage towards the beach).  
The beach is only accessible by food along side the sea through the camping area 
that is populated during summer since it is for free. 
Along the way to the beach there are many apartments with direct view to the sea 
and multiple small islands located around Agkistri, the perfect sport for 
romantic dates and love birds.

Before the sunset, we started heading back. 
Next to the port, a nice cafeteria exists where you can have beautiful view 
towards Sarronic and you can, somehow, enjoy the sunset before taking the ship 
back to Pireaus.

\NewsItem{Hydra, no cars allowed}
Some Greek islands have restrictions to cars and motor bikes, those are the islands 
I call ``no-noisy-irritating islands''. 
After staying too long in Athens, where a majority of cars and motor bikes are modified 
just to be more noisy, the necessity of getting away from this mess is huge. 
Therefore, such islands as Hydra where the transportation is only done by feet and 
donkeys do exist. 

By the September 2017 a friend of mine, Dorine Petit from France came for a 
conference meeting in Athens with her boyfriend Jeremy, and since they 
never been to an island before we decided to visit Hydra. 
Hydra is a large mountaineer islands just an hour and a half away from Pireaus 
port. 
It has one of the most beautiful city port that I ever seeing. 
However, its beaches, the ones that we visited, are mainly rocky.  

\begin{center}

	\par\textit{The port and main city of Hydra}
\end{center}

Since it was my first time and I haven't took any information from friends 
regarding places to visit of restaurants to eat, we followed the rule of thump 
``go where you see the most locals''. 
Usually going to restaurants which are mostly populated by locals it indicates 
good quality of food and value for money. 
To this end, we end up at \textbf{[...]}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{media/hydra_food}
	\par\textit{Amazing mixed grill plate}
\end{center}

To reach the beach \textbf{[NAME OF THE BEACH]}, that locals informed us, 
we had to walk 20 minutes all along the coat line of the island and passing 
through small settlements of the locals. 
The beach was mostly rocky with few brown sand. 
Also, the water had very nice temperature considering the fact that it was 
end of September. 
Dorine and Jeremy really had great time enjoying the water, the sun tanning, 
and the traditional Greek cold coffee, the frappe. 

\begin{center}

\end{center}

Our boat was leaving at 20:00 o'clock, therefore, we took our time to enjoy 
the sunset from the top of cafeteria named \textbf{NAME HERE} while having 
cocktails and discussing past moments and pleasant memories from our masters. 
At some point, we had to go back and embark on the ship. 
That was the moment when Dorine said with a complaining tone in her voice 
``Why are we going back to Athens, let's stay here instead...''. 
Oh my...this attractiveness and charm of the Greek islands it is imaginable.

\NewsItem{What have I learned?}
Proper preparation before every adventure is crucial, especially for places that I 
have never visited before. 
Getting temperature and wind's [measurements] is important to adjusts your clothing, 
food and water supplies, and exploiting transportation options is important, but, 
having great, bad-ass, and crazy companions is even more important. 
When things are not proceed as I planned that makes, on the same time, a new funny 
story to discuss and laugh about it with friends.     
By the end of the day, never forget to enjoy the sunset since it is one the worlds 
wonders, it is magical, and free! 
Also, I carry with me wireless speakers to enjoy music at every moment. 
In my case, I use the water-proof wireless speakers EU roll 2 (a birthday present 
from my dear friends Daniela and Antonis) during hiking or laying on beach.
